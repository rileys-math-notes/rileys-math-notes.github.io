	<h1>Algebra 2</h1>
	
  <p>If you're here, hopefully you're already familiar with Algebra 1. If not, feel free to find a refresher <a href="algebra-1.html"> here</a>.</p>
  <p>Algebra 2 is what I like to call pre-pre calculus, which sounds more daunting than it is. Really, it's a convergence of many topics you're already familiar with, as well as an introduction to some new ones. Much of this course is focused on several new forms of equations and new functions, such as the universally beloved logarithm. But I'm getting ahead of myself. First thing's first: What's the quadratic formula?</p>
  <p>Simply put, the quadratic formula is \[x=\frac{-b+-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\] 
  But what does that mean? That's all letters. There's only two numerals in the whole thing, and they don't help clarify what exactly is going on. To be specific, the quadratic formula is used to solve an equation of the form \[ax^2+bx=-c, \text{ or equivalently } ax^2+bx+c=0\]. You'll notice, because you're quite clever and observant, that this equation has the same <italic>coefficients</italic>, a, b, and c, as the quadratic formula above. Therefore, it should be a fairly simple procedure to plug those coefficients in to our formula and get an answer. Let's start with an example.</p>
  <p>Consider the equation \[3x^2+12x+4=0\]</p>
  <p>With our now extensive knowledge of the quadratic formula, we can identify our coefficients; a=3, b=12, c=4. Now we just plug this in to our formula to get\[x=\frac{-12+-\sqrt{12^2+-4(3)(4)}}{2(3)}=\frac{-12+-\sqrt{120}}{6}=\frac{+-\sqrt{120}}{2}-2\]</p>
